				<h3>13 February, 2026 - Ses. 26</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The party explored the city graveyard and learned of some old catacombs.</li>
					<li>Queen Dahlia Nyxlanyss requested an audience with the party which the party accepted.</li>
					<li>During the meeting, Dahlia asked the party to join her for dinner, which they accepted.</li>
					<li>The party went to the Silver Hammer and met Mintho. There, they upgraded 4 weapons to <em>+2 weapons</em>:
					<ul>
						<li>Drangea: rapier, light crossbow</li>
						<li>Sebastian: quarterstaff</li>
						<li>Lyrix: longbow</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The party got an unofficial quest to get an ancient vampire&#39;s remains from the catacombs to upgrade their blood pendants.</li>
					<li>The party got two <em>potions of healing</em> from the potion shop (Lyrix threatened the shop owner multiple times).</li>
					<li>Hark studied the Forbidden Tome and learned a new ability: Quick Cast.</li>
					<li>Sebastian made a salad for the dinner, and Drangea made a desert.</li>
					<li>The party&#39;s weapons, armor, and foci were removed and they entered the dinner (Queen Dahlia was wearing the &quot;Mantle of Nyxlanyss,&quot; actually Nyxeram).</li>
					<li>During the dinner, Lyrix repeatedly offended the queen and was carried out.</li>
					<li>Queen Dahlia discussed her efforts toward the city (including relocating homeless people and looking into affordable healthcare).</li>
					<li>After the dinner, she left a ruby behind for the party; Hark took 25gp and Sebastian spread out the rest in silver throughout the Slums.</li>
					<li>Before bed, Drangea performed a rite for &quot;Aster&#39;s&quot; sword, and Hark met with secret followers of Oghma asking him to obtain the Song of Fading Light.</li>
					<li>Sebastian learned that the rebellion in his hometown was going poorly due to rampant spreading of disease.</li>
					<li>The next day, the party obtained their enhanced weapons and entered the Nyxlanyss Catacombs.</li>
					<li>Nyxeram taunted them for a few minutes before setting warriors and wizards afflicted with Dark Miasma onto them.</li>
					<li>During the fight, Hark was polymorphed into a Giant Ape and destroyed the enemies with ease.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>30 January, 2026 - Ses. 25</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The party rested for the night after the battle with Nyxeram.</li>
					<li>In the morning, the party found that the construct that controlled the elevator had been destroyed, meaning the elevator couldn&#39;t be used normally.</li>
					<li>After some examining and experimenting, the characters managed to rig the elevator to go up and down via a pulley system.</li>
					<li>After 2 hours and 12 minutes of lowering, the party reached the bottom of the chasm; they found that their darkvision wasn&#39;t working and had to rely on the <em>light</em> cantrip to see.</li>
					<li>After hearing something clicking in the dark for a few minutes, they were attacked by darkened giant spiders and a shadow mangler; the characters ultimately prevailed.</li>
					<li>Continuing on, they found the cave leaking some red liquid; they were careful to avoid touching it when necessary.</li>
					<li>The party ran into Nyxeram who mentioned the red liquid to be water with iron in it.</li>
					<li>Nyxeram also told the party a bit about Nyxlanyss and the Adventurers Culpability Act.</li>
					<li>The party reached the city and were stopped by some guards; a failed attempt to smuggle in a Darkblood fruit resulted in Hark being arrested for the night.</li>
					<li>After doing some exploring, the party rested for the night; Lyrix got super drunk and ended up in jail with Hark.</li>
					<li>Hark and Lyrix were bailed out for 300 gp, and the party continued exploring Nyxlanyss.</li>
					<li>Lyrix and Sebastian went to the slums and attempted to spread some cheer, with relatively low success.</li>
					<li>Hark and Drangea went to the residential district and spoke with some of the people there, learning that they were a little bit racist and believed that Queen Dahlia Nyxlanyss would turn things around for the city.</li>
					<li>The party met up at the graveyard where the session ended.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>23 January, 2026 - Ses. 24</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>After the battle with Drangea, the party rested up for the night.</li>
					<li>In the morning, the party went back to the Silverlight Sanctuary.</li>
					<li>While on their way, they found Rowena Silverguard dead with a note left on her body (&quot;I&#39;ll be seeing you soon!&quot; -N).</li>
					<li>Sebastian and Hark forcefully removed the Darkblood Infection from Lyrix while there.</li>
					<li>The party used their funds to purchase a 300 gp diamond from Priestess Valanthe (for <em>revivify</em>)</li>
					<li>After purchasing some supplies, the party rested for the night and travelled North.</li>
					<li>After a day of travel, the party rested for the night.</li>
					<li>While traveling, the party faced some ankhegs eating a darkened corpse; one of them was darkened and rapidly degenerated itself and its surroundings.</li>
					<li>Afterwards, the party found a well; tossing a coin in produced an imp who offered a wish; Hark killed it shortly after. This repeated twice more.</li>
					<li>The characters talked with an old man who warned the party of the increased danger ahead and gave him some garlic bread.</li>
					<li>The party arrived at the elevator and, after some deliberation, approached a shadowy figure.</li>
					<li>The figure introduced itself as Nyxeram and poked at the characters&#39; personal insecurities. After attempting to turn the party back, it challenged the party to a trial by combat. The party accepted and combat began.</li>
					<li>Before combat, the party leveled up to level 8.</li>
					<li>Drangea awoke just in time for the battle.<ul>
					<li>Hark rolled a concerning number of Nat 1&#39;s and used Relentless Endurance to survive a powerful blow.</li>
					<li>Drangea got a critical sneak attack for 48 damage (halved to 24 due to its resistances).</li>
					<li>Sebastian and Lyrix went down multiple times during the fight, but kept getting back up.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>After defeating Nyxeram, it gave them the Forbidden Tome of Ancient Magics and fled down the chasm.</li>

					<li>While exploring, Lyrix found multiple Darkblood fruits which she consumed.</li>
					<li>The party was attacked by some monsters afflicted with Dark Miasma and Darkblood Infection. During the fight, they seemed unaware of Lyrix&#39;s presence. They defeated the monsters.</li>

					<li>The party learned from Valanthe that the tome of ancient magics had been stolen, although she didn&#39;t know who the culprit was.</li>
					<li>After doing this, the party left the sanctuary to head for Drangea.</li>
					<li>While traveling, the party found an old fortress. Just as they were about to leave, Tenebris found them and attacked.</li>
					<li>Hark, Sebastian, and Lyrix managed to escape, but Aster was left behind on his own; seeing this, he unleashed all of his strength upon Tenebris in one final attack, unleashing a blast of moonlight as bright and powerful as the sun, greatly wounding Tenebris.

					<li>Drangea paid for the Vyrmas blacksmith to upgrade his rapier and crossbow to <em>+1 weapons.</em> They will both be ready in 4 hours.</li>

					<li>Sebastian descended into the secret passage beneath Vortex&#39;s manor and found Salamander revived (along with his new &quot;friend,&quot; Jim Ratkiller). They (somewhat reluctantly) fought and Sebastian triumphed.</li>
					<li>Drangea arrived and joined up to explore the lair. The party found demon summoning circles, a fountain of blood, and the mayor&#39;s hidden treasure stash. While searching the guardroom, 3 statues came to life and attacked, but were ultimately defeated.</li>
					<li>Sebastian found an old journal and discovered more about the mayor&#39;s allies, two cambions named Vassamos and Kalimas. After more exploring, the party solved a puzzle involving books where the initials spelled out &quot;VORTEX.&quot;</li>
					<li>Beyond the secret door, the party found Vortex&#39;s secret journal about his relations with demons and his plans to take over all of the nearby towns. They also discovered that Father Alvin of Vyrmas has been blackmailing Vortex after discovering these plans.</li>
					<li>The party then met Kalimas. Drangea disguised himself as the mayor and tricked him for a bit into revealing some of their plans, but he was ultimately found out and the party ran. Drangea again tried to trick Kalimas but was not particularly successful and used a mirrored illusion to create a distraction to escape.</li>
					<li>Upon escaping, the party found a mirror which opened a video call to Orcus, the demon prince of undeath. After distracting him by teaching him about SMART goals, the party escaped and are ready to attack Kalimas.</li>

				<ul>
					<li>Sebastian and Hark were attacked by Lord Asheblade on their way to town, a wraith who wanted revenge for killing Omen Vortex. After easily dispatching of him, the party entered Vyrmas and began exploring.</li>
					<li>They started in the Mushroom Inn and Tavern by talking to locals to learn information about the Fumewoods and Mithral Foundry. The party found the mayor (Rolen Mellowbutter) who asked for help dealing with a nearby threat.</li>
					<li>This threat turned out to be Vassamos, a cambion who previously laid waste to the town of Cindertree and was defeated by the party. The adventurers dealt with him and his minions (although he teleported away before he could be slain again) and were suitably rewarded for their efforts.</li>
					<li>On their way up to the surface, the party picked up some ingredients from the priest (Father Alvin) and rode the elevator back up to the surface. They used said ingredients to re-establish a teleportation circle between Vyrmas and the Blackmount Citadel.</li>
					<li>After testing it with Spine, the characters explored Mayor Vortex&#39;s manor and found a secret passage in his office leading somewhere down below...</li>

					<li>Sebastian and Brook set out trying to find a beautiful object for Violetta. They eventually settled on a painting of Violetta which they stole from the mayor&#39;s house.</li>
					<li>On their way to give it to her, they were attacked by a strange bug-person-like creature. They fended it off at which point it escaped. They gave the painting to her in exchange for the stone rod.</li>
					<li>They then attacked Mira and defeated her, but not before she had the door seal broken, preventing the characters from having time to rest.</li>
					<li>The party met and attacked Omen Vortex; Hark entered mid-fight to help out, and Omen was eventually slain.</li>
					<li>The party collected their reward from the mayor and descended into the depths of Lorosfyr. They came upon the town of Vyrmas where the session ended.</li>

				<ul>
					<li>While half the party (Sebastian and Ru) continued working against the mayor in town, the rest of the party (Brook, Hark, and Robin) entered the Catacombs to find a crimson mist blanketing the floor.</li>
					<li>Not long after, the party entered a chapel where they fought some ghouls as well as a strange zombie dripping with demon&#39;s blood. The party defeated them, though the blood corroded Hark&#39;s weapon.</li>
					<li>Continuing on, the party fought off some wights and zombies. They attempted to solve a puzzle guarding access to Violetta but were unable to proceed.</li>
					<li>They then went to face off against Mira, a feral vampire spawn. She got beat up badly and mysteriously vanished along with her stone rod.</li>
					<li>The party retreated to town for a bit and bought some ice. They discovered that the crimson mist was a sign of Omen Vortex&#39;s growing power; at midnight tonight during the lunar eclipse, he will rise to his full power and break free, destroying the Blackmount Citadel.</li>
					<li>The party re-entered the Catacombs and solved the puzzle, meeting Violetta who offered some &quot;pleasant&quot; tea. She stated that she will give up her stone rod if the party offers her &quot;something beautiful.&quot; The session ended with the party leaving to figure out something beautiful as an offering.</li>

					<li>The party continued exploring the Catacombs and came across an abandoned tomb where a mummy and two nightsappers attacked; Sebastian was cursed with mummy rot.</li>
					<li>The party then found Knight Maximus and returned him to the Blackmount Citadel. There, he and the party discussed mayor Damon Vortex and what could be done about him.</li>
					<li>The party then set out in search of a cure for mummy rot, discovering that it could be cured using an elixir of sand, cat&#39;s tears, and bird spit. After some shennanigans including Hark entertaining an old lady, Sebastian was cured.</li>

				<ul>
					<li>The session started with the characters pillaging the cambion&#39;s treasure. Upon returning to town, the characters received a Letter of Recognition.</li>
					<li>After a couple days of travel, the characters reached the Blackmount Citadel and explored around. They learned that the mayor is corrupt and being blackmailed by someone after Sebastian snuck into the mayor&#39;s house as a cat. Additionally, a golden knight went into the Catacombs recently; they are the strongest voice against the mayor.</li>
					<li>The next day, the characters went into the Forsaken Catacombs in search of a dark presence; defeating it will allow passage into Lorosfyr. However, the characters need to find a special stone rod with dragons carved into the sides in order to break the seal and defeat it.</li>
					<li>The characters found an archive of the dead interred in the Catacombs. They learned about three notable figures: Salamander, a master of Pyromancy and inventor of <em>fireball</em>; Mira, a vampire spawn who was locked away for centuries but recently escaped; and Violetta, the spirit of a female elf who prized beauty above all.</li>
					<li>The characters fought and defeated the remains of Salamander, who took the form of a Flameskull. The characters then finished off the session by taking a short rest.</li>
